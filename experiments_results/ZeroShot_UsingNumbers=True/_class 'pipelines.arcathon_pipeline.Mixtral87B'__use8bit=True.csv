If a row contains a pattern where there are more non-0s on the right side than the left side (excluding the first and last elements), then the output for that row is all 0s. Otherwise, the output is the same as the input for that row.\n\nBased on this observation, we can generate the output for the given input as follows:\n\noutput:\n[[0000000008]\n [0000000000]\n [0888000000]\n [0888000000]\n [0000000000]\n [0000888888]\n [0000888880]\n [0000888880]\n [0000000000]\n [0000000000]]\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The first row has more non-0s on the right side than the left side, so the output is all 0s.\n* The second row has all 0s, so the output is the same.\n* The third row has the same number of non-0s on both sides, so the output is the same.\n* The fourth row has more non-0s on the right side than the left side, so the output is all 0s.\n* The fifth row has all 0s, so the output is the same.\n* The sixth row has more non-0s on the right side than the left side, so the output is all 0s.\n* The seventh row has more non-0s on the right side than the left side, so the output is all 0s.\n* The eighth row has more non-0s on the right side than the left side, so the output is all 0s.\n* The ninth row has all 0s, so the output is the same.\n* The tenth row has all 0s, so the output is the same.', ""\n\nTo solve the puzzle, we need to find the pattern or transformation that converts the input to the output.

Repeat the above step for all groups of bits in the input.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the given input:\n\ninput:\n[[0000000008], [0800000800], [0888000000], [0888000800], [8000000000], [0000888888], [0000888880], [8000888880], [0080000000], [0000800008]]\n\nFirst, let's group the bits:\n\n[0000000008]\n[0800000800]\n[0888000000]\n[0888000800]\n[8000000000]\n[0000888888]\n[0000888880]\n[8000888880]\n[0080000000]\n[0000800008]\n\nNext, let's apply the rules to each group:\n\n[0000000008] -> [0000000000] (no changes since XOR = 0)\n[0800000800] -> [0000000800] (change leftmost 1 to 0)\n[0888000000] -> [0088000000] (change leftmost 1 to 0)\n[0888000800] -> [0088000800] (no changes since XOR = 0)\n[8000000000] -> [0000000000] (change leftmost 1 to 0)\n[0000888888] -> [0000888888] (no changes since XOR = 0)\n[0000888880] -> [0000888880] (no changes since XOR = 0)\n[8000888880] -> [0000888880] (change leftmost 1 to 0)\n[0080000000] -> [0000000000] (change leftmost 1 to 0)\n[0000800008] -> [0000000008] (change leftmost 1 to 0)\n\nFinally, let's represent the output as a 2D array:\n\noutput:\n[[0000000000],\n [0000000800],\n [0088000000],\n [0088000800],\n [0000000000],\n [0000888888],\n [0000888880],\n [0000888880],\n [0000000000],\n [0000000008]]"", ""\n\nTo solve the puzzle, we need to find the pattern or transformation that converts the input to the output.

If a cell has a 2 or a 1 in the input, and its neighbors (up to 2 cells away) have a total of 3 even numbers of 3's and 2's, then set the center value to 1 in the output.\n4. If a cell has a 2 or a 1 in the input, and its neighbors (up to 2 cells away) have a total of 4 or more even numbers of 3's and 2's, then set the center value to 2 in the output.\n5. For all other cases, copy the center value from the input to the output.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the given input:\n\n[[0550005500][0550005500][5555055000][0000000000][0550000500][0555500500][0000000500][0000000500][0555550000][0000000000]]\n\nApplying rules 1 and 2:\n[[0220002200][0220002200][2222122000][0000000000][0220000200][0222200200][0000000200][0000000200][0222220000][0000000000]]\n\nCounting the even numbers of 3's and 2's for each cell (up to 2 cells away):\n\n[ [3, 3], [3, 3], [6, 4], [0, 0], [3, 3], [6, 4], [0, 0], [0, 0], [6, 4], [0, 0] ]\n\nApplying rules 3 and 4:\n[[0110001100][0110001100][1111111100][0000000000][0110000100][0111111100][0000000100][0000000100][0111111000][0000000000]]\n\nSo, the output for the given input is:\n\n[[0110001100][0110001100][1111111100][0000000000][0110000100][0111111100][0000000100][0000000100][0111111000][0000000000]]"", ""To find the output for the given input, we need to apply the same transformation that was applied to the previous input-output pairs. The transformation appears to be a set of rules that modify each cell in the input grid based on its original value and its neighboring cells.\n\nLet's analyze the input-output pairs and deduce the rules:\n\n1. If a cell has a 0, it remains 0 in the output.\n2. If a cell has a 5, its value in the output is determined by the sum of its horizontal and vertical neighboring 5s (including diagonals).\n\t* If the sum is 1, 2, or 3, the output value is 1.\n\t* If the sum is 4 or 5, the output value is 2.\n\t* If the sum is 6 or 7, the output value is the sum minus 5 (i.e., 1 or 2).\n\t* If the sum is 8 or more, the output value is 0.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the given input:\n\n[[0550005500][0550005500][5555055000][0000000000][0550000500][0555500500][0000000500][0000000500][0555550000][0000000000]]\n\nApplying the rules, we get:\n\n[[0110001100][0110001100][1111011000][0000000000][0110000100][0111101100][0000000100][0000000100][1111100000][0000000000]]\n\nSo, the output for the given input is:\n\n[[0110001100][0110001100][1111011000][0000000000][0110000100][0111101100][0000000100][0000000100][1111100000][0000000000]]""]"
